I am fond of the Western attitude towards a gap year.

There exist travel programs for those who have obtained a BSc and wish to take a break before pursuing their MSc. <br>
In my case, the gap year turned out to be involuntary. Furthermore, it extended far beyond a year. Nevertheless, it harmoniously aligned with the Western approach.

I left Russia at the end of September and only found a new home in February. Although I have yet to tackle lengthy posts about each of the countries I had the opportunity to visit, I desire to showcase the route and document this extraordinary journey.

Kazakhstan 🇰🇿 -> India 🇮🇳 -> Thailand 🇹🇭 -> Malaysia 🇲🇾 -> Thailand Again 🇹🇭 -> Vietnam 🇻🇳... and finally, Serbia 🇷🇸.

The power of such adventures lies in the everyday challenges. New challenges. Ones that had never arisen before. For instance, how does one mount a scooter if they have never even sat on a bicycle? How does one persuade stern Vietnamese border officials at Saigon airport that I am flying to Serbia not as a tourist, but for a new job awaiting me there?

It was truly fascinating. I will never replicate anything similar.
