I am fond of the Western attitude towards a gap year.

There exist travel programs for those who have obtained a BSc and wish to take a break before pursuing their MSc. <br>
In my case, the gap year turned out to be involuntary. Furthermore, it extended far beyond a year. Nevertheless, it harmoniously aligned with the Western approach.

I departed from Russia at the end of September and only found a new home in February - in Europe. Although I have yet to tackle lengthy posts about each of the countries I had the opportunity to visit, I desire to showcase the route and document this extraordinary journey.

Kazakhstan ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¿ -> India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ -> Thailand ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­ -> Malaysia ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾ -> Thailand Again ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­ -> Vietnam ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³... and finally, Serbia ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡¸.

The power of such adventures lies in the everyday challenges. New challenges. Ones that had never arisen before. For instance, how does one mount a scooter if they have never even sat on a bicycle? How does one persuade stern Vietnamese border officials at Saigon airport that I am flying to Serbia not as a tourist, but for a new job awaiting me there?

It was truly fascinating. I will never replicate anything similar.
