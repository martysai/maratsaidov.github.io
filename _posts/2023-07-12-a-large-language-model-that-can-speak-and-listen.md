AudioPaLM: A Large Language Model That Can Speak and Listen.

It has been a month since the release of the novel speech processing model called AudioPaLM. In this survey I try to explain the frontier of the speech signal processing addressing AudioPaLM as an example:

* How transformers capture the textual and speech data without a significant loss in quality;
* Which parts of the study are potentially useful when it is necessary to implement / fine-tune custom speech neural models, i.e. on the specific tasks such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Voice Quality Enhancement (VQE).
