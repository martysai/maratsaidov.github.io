  <summary>A technical blog about Phi Silica – Microsoft’s on-device language model for NPU-powered Copilot+PCs.



The blog covers PTQ, GQA, KV caches, and strategies to increase context length under the constraints of NPU resources (since other models, in addition to Phi Silica, also need to fit on the chip).

I also managed to contribute, albeit a little: Windows Blogs.</summary>

  <summary>I am happy to present CoAT: Corpus of Artificial Texts, a robust and a general benchmark for artificial (GenAI) text detection.



It is published with a help of Cambridge University Press. The work is done during my research assistance at MMCP Lab, HSE University.

CoAT is a large-scale corpus of human-written and AI-generated texts in Russian, spanning 6 domains and 13 different text generati...</summary>

  <summary>I am fond of the Western attitude towards a gap year.

There exist travel programs for those who have obtained a BSc and wish to take a break before pursuing their MSc. 
In my case, the gap year turned out to be involuntary. Furthermore, it extended far beyond a year. Nevertheless, it harmoniously aligned with the Western approach.

I left Russia at the end of September and only found a new hom...</summary>

  <summary>The MVP for a model serving cloud-native solution.

At my previous role, we actively set up a production environment for deploying hundreds of machine learning models. I want to talk about the central metric in this task - RPS (requests per second) - and the first step taken to improve it.

Typically, RPS is associated with Site Reliability Engineering. Often, it involves web services with heav...</summary>
