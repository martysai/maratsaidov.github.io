<p>There exist travel programs for those who have obtained a BSc and wish to take a break before pursuing their MSc. <br />
In my case, the gap year turned out to be involuntary. Furthermore, it extended far beyond a year. Nevertheless, it harmoniously aligned with the Western approach.</p>

<p>I left Russia at the end of September and only found a new home in February. Although I have yet to tackle lengthy posts about each of the countries I had the opportunity to visit, I desire to showcase the route and document this extraordinary journey.</p>

<p>Kazakhstan ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿ -&gt; India ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ -&gt; Thailand ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡­ -&gt; Malaysia ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡¾ -&gt; Thailand Again ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡­ -&gt; Vietnam ğŸ‡»ğŸ‡³â€¦ and finally, Serbia ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡¸.</p>

<p>The power of such adventures lies in the everyday challenges. New challenges. Ones that had never arisen before. For instance, how does one mount a scooter if they have never even sat on a bicycle? How does one persuade stern Vietnamese border officials at Saigon airport that I am flying to Serbia not as a tourist, but for a new job awaiting me there?</p>

<p>It was truly fascinating. I will never replicate anything similar.</p>]]></content><author><name>Marat Saidov</name><email>marat.a.saidov@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am fond of the Western attitude towards a gap year.]]></summary></entry></feed>
