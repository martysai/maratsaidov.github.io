Hello, I am Marat! I am a versatile and dedicated engineer with a strong focus on ML product development for natural languages and human speech.

I work at Applied Sciences Group, Microsoft. As a part of this group, I contribute to the LLM platform and Text Intelligence scenarios, enabling language models across Microsoft products, including Windows OS.
